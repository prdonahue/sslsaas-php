# sslsaas-php
Sample code that demonstrates how to issue SSL certificates for custom hostnames
using Cloudflare's [PHP library](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-php).

## Installation

You need a working PHP environment with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed.

```
composer require cloudflare/sdk
```

## Usage

You'll then want to set environment variables with your Cloudflare username and
API key:

```
export CF_API_KEY=YOURKEY
export CF_API_EMAIL=YOUREMAIL
```

Next, because this code generates hostnames based on the current time, you'll
need to provide the (sub)domain on which these hosts should sit. To facilitate
testing, it is recommended that you configure your "customer's" authoritative
DNS provider to do wildcard resolution to your Managed CNAME zone.

For example, *.customer-domain.com should resolve to whitelabel.yourzone.com.

You should also explicitly specifiy the zone in which the whitelabel hostname
resides as this is how the program checks to see that the auto-generated
"customer" hostname points in to your domain correctly (via CNAME).

```
export CUSTOMERDOMAIN=custer-domain.com
export WHITELABELZONE=yourzone.com
export WHITELABELHOST=whitelabel.yourzone.com
```

Then, to run, simply execute the program:
```
php issuecert.php
```

## Example Output

```
$ php issuecert.php
